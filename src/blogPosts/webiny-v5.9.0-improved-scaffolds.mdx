<br/>

We've just released Webiny 5.9.0, and with it, we've introduced a number of new fixes and improvements, one of which are the improvements to the existing scaffolding utilities and development workflows. While working on these, we also got the chance to revise some of the development workflows that were already in place.

In this blog post, I wanted to quickly go over these improvements. Talk a bit about what were the issues we and our users were experiencing and how we've managed to resolve them. And, in the 2nd part of this post, we're going to give you a short demo.

So, let's go!

## Issues and how we've solved them

There were a couple of issues that were present in the previous solution.

### 1. Complex ElasticSearch Setup

Prior to Webiny 5.9.0, the existing **Admin Area Package** and **GraphQL API Package** scaffolds (now **Extend Admin Area** and **Extend GraphQL API**)

### 2. Manual Steps
- no install / uninstall steps
- no manual steps / additional software installations

### 3. Monorepo Hurdles
- no monorepo packages / scattered around your project / watches / yarn issues

### 4. One Scaffold To Rule Them All

### 5. New Testing Approaches
