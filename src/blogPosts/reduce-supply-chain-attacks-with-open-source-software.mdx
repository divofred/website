Security is a terrifying field to be in these days. Hacking tools have reached a maturity and complexity that makes it much easier to develop and run automated campaigns. Sometimes it only seems a matter of time before some new security vulnerability comes to light, or a new exploit is used by organized, deliberate and motivated individuals.

One of the most worrying trends in recent years comes from supply chain attacks. A supply chain attack is when an organization uses indirect targets to achieve their objectives: for example, if you wanted to gain access to an organization with very high standard of security, attackers will find a great deal of opposition in their way. Instead, if they attack a smaller organization that supplies the target with some service that they need, they will face less difficulty. 

This is like using an unguarded, back-door entrance instead of a full-frontal attack. And it often works.

One of the most significant and infamous of recent years has been the Solar Winds attack. Solar Winds supplies a large range of organizations with security software. On December 8, 2020 they discovered a breach whilst investigating another attack. Later, they discovered the infiltration had been in place for about 14 months. It is not clear who the ultimate target was, and this may never be made public.

[In this article, CISO Tim Brown shares 3 key lessons from the attack](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/3-years-later-solarwinds-ciso-shares-3-lessons-from-the-infamous-attack), which includes the step to "measure risk and invest in controls".

With this step, it becomes incumbent on suppliers to ensure they are diligent with security. But smaller organizations inherently have less resources with which to monitor and combat cyber criminals. So how do smaller organizations become more secure?

## Openness: a Key To A Secure Future

The issue we see is that suppliers need to be more open with the state of their security and the codebase behind their products. But this is going to be a challenge because their codebase is often a closely guarded secret, which if they were to become public, could undermine the organization. 

This is true of security software as it is true of other suppliers, such as Content Management systems as well as Digital Experience Platforms.

Many of these platforms provide a great deal of value for their customers, but are also a security risk because of their being closed systems, which could be injected with malicious code without anybody realizing it.

The only way forward is to connect with suppliers that are open by nature. This is one of the clear benefits of utilizing open source software.

With open source, the codebase cannot be effectively attacked since it's in the public domain: it will immediately become apparent that someone is attempting to inject malicious code. And every line of the codebase can be examined freely by security practitioners to ensure there are no risks.

With open source Content Management Systems such as Webiny, the value we provide is in the consultation and feature-driven support. For example, we can help your engineering teams get set up and start using Webiny on your own infrastructure. And we can provide an agreed level of support to implement features the software may not have already.

This is one of the clearest benefits of open source software. But there are other features Webiny comes with that can help mitigate security risks.

## Authorization and Authentication with Webiny

Webiny in particular does not rely on it's own account creation and management, even as a free, open source CMS. Instead, we utilize AWS Cognito to provide these functions. Our system only has access to only a finite subset of data that's needed to operate.

[See more about how security works in Webiny here](https://www.webiny.com/docs/core-development-concepts/security-framework/introduction).

Any other third party software that is secure and has been contracted by your organization can be used, as long as it allows for programmatic access. this is because Webiny has been constructed with a high level of abstraction built on plugins so that it can be highly customized.

## Security As a First Class Citizen

With Open source software, and with Webiny in particular, it's a lot easier to secure your perimeter and be assured that risks can continue to be mitigated.
