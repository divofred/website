## 🆕 What’s New In Webiny 4.9.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of improvements and fixes in different areas of Webiny. Let’s check them out!

## 🚀 Features

* **Improved UX on existing scaffolding tools** ([#1193](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1193))

This week, we decided to apply final polishes to all of the scaffolding tools that come with every Webiny project. So now, while the scaffolding tools are doing their thing, the user will see informative messages about the changes and additions made in the project files. And with that, some of the scaffolds will print the next steps, so that the user immediately knows what to do next. Check the [#1193](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1193) to see every scaffold in action!

* **Page builder app**: add support for two-way element settings linking ([afcde15](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/afcde1526ce5529026468d9fc2995397773548be))
* Add `context-after-content-models` plugin ([a859fe1](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/a859fe1bd46a4c79edb8e50d53a27658c3bdd8d6))
* Introduce `wait` helper function ([3ed941b](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/3ed941b0b8f3e96a3670de327a7c250bf45dc829))

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

* App-template-admin-full: apply user plugins after the template plugins ([#1178](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/1178)) ([ec76ff1](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/ec76ff1ee63ff4ca2cac5619b6de127519939b66))
* Enable `getContentModels` and `listContentModels` in the READ/PREVIEW API ([6c57c76](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/6c57c763511923b5a482b1decdb97da0db85028d))
* Simplify file tags form ([5ac70cd](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/5ac70cd38a34c16d78498521711e882393de0bc0))
