Thank you everyone for your great response to our community calls.
We will have our next community call this Wednesday, 23rd March 2022 at 2:00 pm GMT! 

We're making it much easier for teams to get started with the Headless CMS by launching a NextJS starter kit. Ben Read from our DevRel team will walk us through a quick demo of how to use it.

In this session, we will also talk about the new Business tier. And, of course, if you have any questions related to Webiny or serverless, be ready with them.
