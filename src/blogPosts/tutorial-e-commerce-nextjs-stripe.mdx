In this tutorial, we will create a simple e-commerce website, where you can buy Swag from the best Open Source projects such as Webiny, Next.js, React, etc.

Before we continue, let's go through what you'll learn about building this website.

You will learn how to create the back-end using Webiny Headless
CMS and set up two content models, the products, and the categories.
Afterward, we'll fetch the data from the Headless CMS to the
Next.js project using Apollo GraphQL. Last but not least, we'll integrate Stripe to implement a checkout experience.

While working on this starter, I shared my progress on Twitter, and <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/joshuaackerman">Josh</ExternalLink> from Stripe <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/joshuaackerman/status/1305857426059653122?s=20">reached out</ExternalLink>
for being available for any feedback regarding improvements, developer experience, and documentation. Thank you, Josh!
Without further ado, let's get started.

First, let's take a look at the diagram of what we'll build ‚¨áÔ∏è

![E commerce starter](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/diagram-e-comm.png)

Without further ado let's get started.

## 1. The e-commerce-starter

To get started, we'll clone the `e-commerce-starter` git repository.

The starter will have a ready-made Next.js application, and the Ant Design UI Library.
We already have some components and functionalities ready, such as the `Header`, `Search`, `Product List`, the `Product` card, and the `Cart` component.
Check out the image below.

![E commerce starter](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/e-commerce-starter.png)

Clone the `e-commerce-starter` project by running the following commands to have the project set up and running.

```
git clone https://github.com/webiny/e-commerce-starter

cd e-commerce-starter

yarn install

yarn run dev

// head over to localhost:3000
```

:::note Note
For the e-commerce starter project we use static data, throughout the tutorial we will update the project so the data is pulled from the Headless CMS via the GraphQL API.
:::

Now that we have the starter project, we can focus on creating the back-end using Webiny Headless CMS.

## 2. Webiny Headless CMS

### Prerequisites

- **A Webiny Headless CMS Project**

  First of all, make sure you have a working <ExternalLink href="http://docs.webiny.com/docs/get-started/quick-start?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-h3-tutorial&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-quick-start-guide&utm_term=W00214">Webiny project</ExternalLink> set up.

- **Content Delivery API URL**

  The Headless CMS app exposes data via the Content Delivery API,
  which is a simple GraphQL API that dynamically updates its schema
  on content model changes. Once you have deployed your API stack
  (using the yarn webiny deploy api --env=local command), you should
  be able to find the Content Delivery API URL in the API Information
  menu item, in your admin app.

  ![Admin App](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/admin-app.png)

- **Content Delivery API Access Token**

  In order to access the data via the Content Delivery API, we'll need a valid `Access Token`.

  1.  Follow the <ExternalLink href="https://docs.webiny.com/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/access-tokens?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-h3-tutorial&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-headless-cms-access-tokens&utm_term=W00187">link</ExternalLink> here to create an access token
      for a specific environment.

:::warning Warning
In the root of the e-commerce-starter app that you've set up,
you will find the .env file, that's the place where you need to
save the Content Delivery API, and the Content Delivery API
Access Token | Make sure to set up your .env file before proceeding to the next steps.
:::

Now that we have all of the prerequisites out of the way, it's time to create the <ExternalLink href="https://docs.webiny.com/docs/webiny-apps/headless-cms/features/content-modeling/?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-h3-tutorial&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-headless-cms-content-modeling&utm_term=W00182">content models</ExternalLink> for the e-commerce website.

We are going to create two content models, the products and category.
First, you have to run your Headless CMS backend project, then open the admin menu and head over to the Content Models as shown in the image below.

![Content models admin menu](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/content-models.png)

Click on the `Models` menu item, and from there you'll create the content models by clicking on the `plus` button on the right corner on the bottom.

The images below will guide you through the fields we'll use to create our content models.

The `Category` content model.

![Category content model](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/category_content_model.png)
Comment: Provide a screenshot of the menu of content models.

The `Category` content model will contain the fields such as:

- Title - `Text(entry title)`

The `Products` content model.

![Products content model](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/products_content_model.png)

The `Products` content model, will contain the fields as shown in the image:

- Title - `Text`
- Image - `Files`
- Price - `Number`
- Description - `Long text`
- Permalink - `Text`, and
- Category - `Reference(multiple values)`.

When adding a `Reference field`, you can toggle the `Use as a list of references` switch in field settings, to do a multi-select. In this case, a product can have multiple categories.

![Products Ref Field](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/products_ref_field.png)

Once the content models are created, add a few record entries to each üéâ

![Content models admin menu](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/content-models-menu.png)

## 3. Next.js + Apollo GraphQL to fetch data from the backend

Now, finally, we're going to start fetching the actual content from the Content Delivery API.

Start off by installing a few NPM packages in the `e-commerce-starter` project:

- `@apollo/client` - This single package contains virtually everything we need to set up Apollo Client. It includes the in-memory cache, local state management, error handling, and a React-based view layer.

- `graphql` - This package provides logic for parsing GraphQL queries.

```ts
yarn i @apollo/client graphql --save
```

Now that you installed the necessary packages, let's check the `e-commerce-starter` website structure in the image below:

![E commerce starter structure](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/e-commerce-starter-structure-2.png)

- `/components` folder contains the react `antd` starter components, as seen in the image above.
- `/context/context.js` contains the React context that holds the state of the `Cart`, `Favorite` products, Shopping Cart, and `Total` price of the cart.
- `/pages/api/payment_intents.js` file provides a server side function for the Stripe integration.
- `/pages/_app.js` component file is provided by Next.js, and serves as a wrapper of every single Next.js page of your frontend.
  The `pages/_app.js` file allows us to wrap the `Apollo Provider` around the function component so that we can have it available in every single page.

  Now, you may ask What is Apollo Provider‚ÅâÔ∏è Good point ‚ÄºÔ∏è We'll get back to this later when we set up the ApolloClient.

---

We've covered the packages used and the folder structure of our `e-commerce-starter` app, let's jump on the code.

Open the `pages/_app.js` file and replace the existing code with the following snippet:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/22688a0c4fac917a17f3ddaec13fc9b5`

As you can see, the `pages/_app.js` has different external components that act as wrappers to our Next.js app.

- `LayoutComponent` - Holds the base layout for our app.
- `CartProvider` - Is the React context for state management, in this case for the products cart data.
- `ApolloProvider` - We'll explain the `ApolloProvider` below.

Let's go into the actual GraphQL client file.

Go ahead in the root of the project, and create the `lib/apolloClient.js` file, and paste the following snippet:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/3d251625b1665f06c05cc7d6d643764b`

The important bit of the above snippet is the new instance of `ApolloClient`
which has some options such as the `link` ‚Üí this is the part where we
tell the Apollo how to go and fetch the data, and we do that by calling a new instance of `HttpLink`,
and pass the options to this, which is the `URI` ‚Üí That means: `Where on the internet does your GraphQL URL exist?` üöÄ
This is where the Webiny's `Content Delivery API` URL comes into play.

Now, finally, we are going to start fetching the actual content from our Headless CMS back-end project. üöÄüöÄ

With this set-up, now you have the `apolloClient` that is passed to the `ApolloProvider` in
the `pages/_app.js` file, for the `ApolloProvider` wraps every single page within our application,
you can actually go into a page, and import a hook called `useQuery` and the `gql`.
With these two, you can perform queries against our GraphQL API. Let's do that!

Navigate to the `components/ProductList.js` file, and replace the code with the below snippet:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/6de0c012c0041e883f34be3a40db50b9`

We've defined the QUERY, where we fetch the list of products, and it's fields. Besides the products, we also fetch the categories' content model.

:::info Info
For now, we are still using static data in the `components/Categories.js` component, to use your actual data, you have to fetch the `categories` data in
the `components/Categories.js` file. Furthermore, you can freely open a PR to place this feature on the `e-commerce-starter` project. Make it your first, or second PR @ <ExternalLink href="https://www.webiny.com/?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-website&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-website&utm_term=W00258">Webiny</ExternalLink>. üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ
Head over to our <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/e-commerce-starter?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-github-community&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-github-community-repo&utm_term=W00259">project repository </ExternalLink> to open the PR üöÄ
:::

Now, you will use the `QUERY` with the `useQuery` hook, which will return the `data`, the `error`, and a boolean `loading`,
for whether it's still loading the data.

When you get the data from the Headless CMS, in the starter project we implemented a simple `search` functionality for the products.
The `search` input value is received through the `props` of the `components/ProductList` component.

Before jumping on the `localhost:3000/` to see the actual data, you need to add one more detail!

> Next.js provides different methods for fetching data, one of them is `getStaticProps` - this method allows you to update **existing** pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in.

Navigate to the `pages/index.js` file, and replace its content with the following snippet:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/ff8a1b41a945b8b2e82bba8209fbac24`

The `getStaticProps` function gets called at build time on server-side.
It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do direct database queries.

Inside this function, you are querying the GraphQL API, and cashing the data in the background. Now, you can freely update your content on the Webiny Headless CMS üéâ

![Fetching products](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/fetching-data.png)

As you can see, I already created some products on my Headless CMS back-end project!

Now that we have the data, let's go and check the `components/ProductCard` component that came
with the `e-commerce-starter` pack üöÄ Navigate to the `components/Product.js` file,
there you'll find the product cart functionalities such as `addToCart`,
`removeFromCart`, and `addToFavorites`. One functionality is missing though,
and that is the `goToProduct` that should open a modal, and show the product details‚ÅâÔ∏è

You can freely open a PR for the `goToProduct` function and make it your first PR @ <ExternalLink href="https://www.webiny.com/?utm_source=Webiny-blog&utm_medium=webiny-website&utm_campaign=webiny-blog-e-commerce-next-oct-26&utm_content=webiny-website&utm_term=W00258">Webiny</ExternalLink>. üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ

## 4. Next.js + Stripe to create the payment intents

In this section, you will use the Stripe Payment intents API with Next.js to integrate Stripe for our shopping cart, and
follow best practices as set out by Stripe and the industry.

### Prerequisites

Before you continue, let's get ready for the section by following the two prerequisites below.

1. Create a <ExternalLink href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe account</ExternalLink>
2. You need the `Publishable` and `Secret` Key from the <ExternalLink href="http://dashboard.stripe.com">dashboard.stripe.com</ExternalLink>

---

We already have pre-build components such as the `components/CheckoutForm.js`, and the `components/Layout.js` component in the
`e-commerce-starter` app, but these two are not complete! We'll work on them in this section.

The `components/CheckoutForm.js` component has the `billingDetails` and an empty spot
for the `CardElement` in the `<CardElementContainer></CardElementContainer>` where you are going to add it, and it has a submit button and a
spot to display some errors. Let's take a look at the existing `components/CheckoutForm.js` file below:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/b3efdb52196d42113b130dace41159f2`

For the `components/Layout.js` component, you can think of it as a wrapper component around
all of our pages on the site. In here you'll load the Stripe library later when we'll start coding.

Have a look at the existing `components/Layout.js` component below:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/dce28e953da3c7c8f8c3a62e3bb0dc4c`

One last check regarding the Stripe integration before you can actually start coding, you need to save the two Stripe keys in a `sticky desktop note` or anywhere it's easier for you to grab the data later:

```ts
PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_test_1234;

SECRET_KEY = sk_test_1234;
```

The `publishable` and the `secret` key can be found in the Stripe dashboard,
make sure to sign up for a Stripe account if you didn't already,
and navigate to the <ExternalLink href="http://dashboard.stripe.com">dashboard.stripe.com</ExternalLink> - make
sure that you are `Viewing test data`, if not, toggle it `on`.
Click on `Developers` and on the `API keys` as shown in the image below.

On the right, you will find the data for your publishable and secret keys.

> Tip: Don't reveal your keys, if you do so by accident, go on the right and click on `Roll key...`

![Stripe Dashboard](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/stripe-dashboard.png)

Now, run the `e-commerce-starter` project by running the `yarn run dev`, and the project will be served in the `localhost:3000`

When clicking on the cart, and proceed to do the payment, this is the view you'll get in `/checkout` page. üöÄ

![Checkout page](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/checkout_page.png)

Let's go and add the `Pay` functionality!

---

Install the below packages in the `e-commerce-starter`:

```ts
yarn install stripe @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js axios --save
```

Now, head back to the code editor and open the `component/Layout.js`
file and add these changes:

```ts
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";
import { Elements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const stripePromise = loadStripe("YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY");
```

:::warning Note
You have to replace the `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your publishable Stripe's key before proceeding.
:::

Now, we have a Stripe promise which resolves to Stripe's JavaScript file,
we have to find a way to inject that Stripe's JavaScript object into the
rest of our Next.js components.

To do that, we will use the `Elements` provider from `react-stripe-js`
library, and wrap the `{props.children}` in the `Elements` provider at line `48` in the `components/Layout.js` component:

```ts
<Elements stripe={stripePromise}>{props.children}</Elements>
```

Next, you'll need the Card input to provide the credit cart for the checkout, you'll use the Stripe's `CardElement` component.

:::into Info
The Card Element lets you collect card information all within one Element. It includes a dynamically-updating card brand icon as well as inputs for number, expiry, CVC, and postal code. - <ExternalLink href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js">Resource</ExternalLink>
:::

Navigate to the `components/CheckoutForm.js` file and import the `CardElement` like so:

```ts
import { CardElement } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";
```

Now, add the `CardElement` to the `CardElementContainer`, on line `88`

```ts
<CardElementContainer>
  <CardElement />
</CardElementContainer>
```

You should see now a Card input in the `/checkout` page, check out the image below.

![Card input](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/card_input.png)

Let's go and change the styles of the Card input by adding
the `options` prop to the `CardElement` and passing there the
`cardElementOpts` variable that was pre-build with the `e-commerce-starter`, check out the below snippet.

```ts
<CardElementContainer>
  <CardElement options={cardElementOpts} onChange={handleCardDetailsChange} />
</CardElementContainer>
```

![Card input designed](./assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/card_input_designed.png)

Whoa! üöÄ Now that we have the Card input set-up, one thing is
missing and that is the payment, we are not able to accept payments yet.

:::info Note
Head over to `components/CheckoutForm.js` to continue adding the payment functionality.
:::

**The steps we will do are:**

1. Create a payment intent on the server

   1. One request to the Stripe node library, to get the `client_secret` of that payment intent

2. Create a payment method

   1. To create a payment method, we will need a reference of Stripe's object which has the function to create the `payment method`
   2. When we create the `payment method` we will need a reference to the `CardElement` that we defined earlier.

3. Confirm the card payment

   1. We will combine the `payment method` id, and use the `client_secret` that we'll get from the first step.

---

**1. Create a payment intent on the server**

Now, we will use `axios` to make a `post` request to the server-side of the Next.js app from the `components/CheckoutForm.js` file.

First, import `axios` library to the `components/CheckoutForm.js` component as below.

```ts
import axios from "axios";
```

Inside the `handleSumit` function at `61` line, paste the below code.

```ts
try {
  const { data: clientSecret } = await axios.post("/api/payment_intents", {
    amount: totalPrice * 100,
  });

  console.log("clientSecret:", clientSecret);
} catch (err) {
  setCheckoutError(err.message);
}
```

The `totalPrice` we are getting is from the `total` context,
that holds the total price of all the products that are added on the `Cart`.
Whenever the price changes, it will end up into the `total` context and
triple down into our component `components/CheckoutForm.js`

Now, let's check what is happening on the server side,
navigate to `pages/api/payment_intents.js`. Check out the code snipped below:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/757544d7953962842bfac5a50f9a6010`

:::note Note:
Provide your Stripe `secret key` on the 4th line on `pages/api/payment_intents.js`
:::

As you can see, for the `/payment_intents` endpoint, we have a simple handler.
We extract the `amount` from the request body,
we make a request to `stripe.paymentIntents.create`
sending the `amount` and the `currency`, and we return the payment intents `client secret`.

Now, go back to Chrome and see what happens when we have the credit card number in the input üöÄ

:::note Note:
Stripe provides test credit cards: for a default U.S. card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
:::

In the console tab of developer tools, if there are no errors,
you'll see the `clientSecret` logged.

We will be using the `clientSecret` to confirm the card payment after we create the payment method!

**2. Create a payment method**

Now, use the Stripe's createPaymentMethod, `stripe.createPaymentMethod` in the `components/CheckoutForm.js` file, provide the card type that you'll get
from the `CardElement` of the `react-stripe-js` library, and the `billing_details` from our form, follow the snippets below.

First, import the following from the Stripe's `react-stripe-js` library:

```ts
import { CardElement, useStripe, useElements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";
```

Second, inside the `CheckoutForm` component, on line `53` add the reference to the elements
object using the `useElements()` hook and the reference to the Stripe object, using `useStripe()` hook.

```ts
const stripe = useStripe();
const elements = useElements();
```

Third, paste the `paymentMethodReq` method by placing it under the `clientSecret` request in the `try and catch` statement.

```ts
try {
  const { data: clientSecret } = await axios.post("/api/payment_intents", {
    amount: totalPrice * 100,
  });

  console.log("clientSecret:", clientSecret);

  // create the payment method:
  const paymentMethodReq = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
    type: "card",
    card: cardElement,
    billing_details: billingDetails,
  });

  console.log("paymentMethodReq: ", paymentMethodReq);
} catch (err) {
  setCheckoutError(err.message);
}
```

Now let's head over to chrome's developer tools console. üôÇ

![Payment method Request](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/payment_method_req.png)

This is what we'll get from the `paymentMethodReq`,
it resolved to a `paymentMethod` object which has a
`paymentMethod` id which we'll going to use to confirm
the card payment üéâ

**3. Confirm the card payment**

Now, we'll confirm the card payment by using the `confirmCardPayment`
Stripe's method in which we will provide the `paymentMethod.id` we got earlier.
Add the following snippet on `components/CheckoutForm.js` file, just after the `paymentMethodReq`:

```ts
const confirmCardPayment = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
  payment_method: paymentMethodReq.paymentMethod.id,
});

console.log("confirmCardPayment: ", confirmCardPayment);
```

Now, go ahead at `localhost:3000` and add
some products to the cart, and hit `pay`, check on the console
log to find the below result:

![Confirm Payment Method](/assets/e-commerce-tutorial-nextjs-stripe/payment_intent.png)

We got the `paymentIntent` id, and the `status` which is `succeeded`.

Check out the below snippet, to get the full code for the `components/CheckoutForm.js` file:

`gist:AlbionaHoti/e417c1374d7539e729c06f8bcd42e3bb`

So far, we successfully created a functional payment integration with Stripe. üéâ We started by
adding the card input with Stripe javascript libraries, and continued with the set-up of
payment intent, the payment method, and lastly, confirm the card payment.

## Summary
