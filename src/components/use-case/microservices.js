                        Webiny CLI deploys your microservice to the Webiny Serverless Cloud using an
                        automated process. Itâ€™s a single command and your service is live almost
                        instantly.

                    <p>
                        In some cases, you need to update only a particular service, in others a set
                        of services, and once in a while, you might need to update all of your
                        services. Webiny CLI makes it super easy to do just that.

                        well as you can connect and call any 3rd party API.

                        With Webiny you can create new GraphQL APIs, that are registered with Apollo
                        Gateway. You can also create generic services that are invoked via an HTTP
                        request on a specified URL.

                        Building and deploying microservices requires significant time. Webiny
                        enables you to have your services up and running in less time and with less
                        effort leaving time for more important things.

                        Webiny Serverless Cloud hosts your microservices inside a managed cloud
                        which scales and removes you from the tasks of managing functions and
                        configuring API gateways, certificates and more.
