#### Step 1: Install and Deploy Webiny

</span>

Skip this step if you already have Webiny installed and deployed. Be sure to check out the [prerequisites](https://www.webiny.com/docs/get-started/install-webiny#prerequisites) for installing Webiny on your local machine.

Then, create a new Webiny project by running

```bash
npx create-webiny-project my-webiny-project
```

If you get stuck or for more details, please see our documentation.

<img src={GC} alt="One click Gatsby install button" class="install-button" />

Instead, if you want to start locally, create a new Gatsby project by running the following command:

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

Create a new `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following values:

```bash
WEBINY_API_TOKEN=<your-url-here>
WEBINY_API_URL=<your-token-here>
```

Next, add the plugin `gatsby-source-graphql` to fetch data from Webiny:

```bash
npm install gatsby-source-graphql
```

Open the file `gatsby-config.js` and add the following:

```javascript
require("dotenv").config({
    path: `.env`,
  })

  module.exports = {
    // other config
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
        options: {
          typeName: "Webiny",
          fieldName: "webiny",
          url: process.env.WEBINY_API_URL,
          headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.WEBINY_API_TOKEN}`
          }
        }
      }
   ]
}
```

Now run the following command:

```bash
npm run develop
```

Open the browser at the url [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql). You should see the webiny content source listed.
